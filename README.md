# Fretron-Assignment


This repository contains solutions to two distinct problems:

- **No Accident Please**: A flight path visualization tool built with React and D3.js.
- **My Money My Shares**: A C++ program to distribute apples based on the amount paid by each person.



## No Accident Please

### Description

The "No Accident Please" project visualizes flight paths using React and D3.js. Given multiple sets of coordinates for different flights starting from the same point, the tool renders the flight paths on a 2D plane while ensuring that no paths intersect for safety and optimization.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.

### Setup and Usage

To get started, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-path-visualization.git
cd flight-path-visualization
npm install
npm run dev 

## My Money My Shares

### Description

The "My Money My Shares" project is a C++ program that distributes apples among three people (Ram, Sham, and Rahim) based on the amount each person paid. Each apple is allocated in full to one of the individuals without cutting any apples.

### Technologies Used

- **Cpp**: For Writing Solution

### Setup and Usage

To get started, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-path-visualization.git
cd MyMoneyMyShares
run index.cpp
